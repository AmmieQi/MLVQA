# OpenVQA
OpenVQA is a general platform for visual question ansering (VQA) research, with implementing state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., [BUTD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998), [MFH](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03619), [BAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07932) and [MCAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10770)) on different benchmark datasets like [VQA-v2](https://visualqa.org/), [GQA](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/dorarad/gqa/index.html) and [CLEVR](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/). Supports for more methods and datasets will be updated continuously.
